# blueflux
Ultra lightweight "flux like UDF toolkit" for Android uses Kotlin and rxjava2. 

I used the word "toolkit" rather than "framework" because blueflux does not rigidly require you to really do anything.  It is simply a set of lightweight interfaces and classes that facilitate using an UDF architecture within an Android application.  

There is no overarching framework and blueflux can be leveraged for just a single Fragment, or a single Activity, or if you want, several Fragments and Activities together.  The beauty is that it does not force any requirements upon your application as a whole.  Use it as little or as much as you see fit.  The if, where, how, and why are completely flexible and up to you and your creativity.
