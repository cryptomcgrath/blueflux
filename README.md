# blueflux
Ultra lightweight "flux like UDF toolkit" for Android uses Kotlin and rxjava2. 

I used the word toolit rather than framework because blueflux does not rigidly require you do really do anything.  It is simply a set of lightweight classes that facilitate using an UDF architecture within an Android application.  

There is no overarching framework and blueflux can be leveraged for just a single Fragment, a single Actiity, or if you want a set of related Fragments and Activities.  The beauty is that it does not force any requirements upon your applicaiton as a whole.  Use it as little or as much as you see fit, and in which ever way that fits your need best.
